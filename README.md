# Image_Classification_Model
``` shell
Description:
This project implements an image classification model using deep learning techniques to automatically categorize images into predefined classes. The model learns to extract features directly from raw image data, enabling it to recognize and classify unseen images with high accuracy.
It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which is the industry standard for image-related tasks, due to its strong ability to detect patterns like edges, textures, and shapes in visual data.
A deep learning-based CNN model for accurate image classification â€” built with TensorFlow.
